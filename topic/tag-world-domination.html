excerpt: "This used to read as 'make money online' when I first started toying with the subject. It also was home for my rants when I was still working in the public relations side of things in the hotel industry. I still make money from my blogs and other online activities. World Domination has since expanded into other conquests in life. Money isn't everything, but it sure as hell makes life a whole lot better."
