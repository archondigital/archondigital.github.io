				<h2>Hi, I'm Jon, I run Archon Digital.</h2>
				<p>I'm a graphic designer who started in print before shifting to design and development on the web.</p>

				<p>Since 2005, I've been doing frontend development and some work on servers both during work and in my free time. When I am not at work, I take photographs of the street life around me either in film or on digital.</p>

				<p>I currently work in the Presidential Communications Development and Strategic Planning Office as technical lead in the development of the <a href="http://www.gov.ph" target="_blank">Official Gazette PH</a>, <a href="http://data.gov.ph" target="_blank">Open Data PH</a> and its other online initiatives.</p>

				<p>This is my personal website. What I <a href="#blog">post here</a>, my views, rants, etc... does not in any way represent that of the office that I work for.</p>
