Last year, I told myself that I will arrive much earlier to be able to take more photos of this year's Chinese New Year celebrations compared to last one. I ended up spending the entire day taking photos, but I got sick almost immediately after and totally forgot about it. It was by the end of February when I was able to take a look at my photos well after the festivities were over. I took around 800 photos, skimmed through most and chose around 52. Here is one of those photos, I'll publish the rest soon.

Taken using a [Leica Summicron-M 1:2/35mm ASPH][6] lens at 1/500s f/8 ISO 2000. [See image on Flickr][1]{:target="_blank"} for EXIF.
