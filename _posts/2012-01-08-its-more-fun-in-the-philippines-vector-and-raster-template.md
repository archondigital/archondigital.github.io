    Note: You will need Adobe Photoshop or any other image editing program to edit and use the PNG files and Abode Illustrator or any other vector editing application to edit the EPS files. EPS files from Illustrator can be copied and pasted into Photoshop as a Smart Object which will allow you more flexibility in creating your own "It's more fun in the Philippines" artwork.

I'll be posting my own studies which you can use and share to help in promoting tourism in Philippines. Until then, I hope you'd find the template files helpful.
