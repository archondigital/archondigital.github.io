I have been following the stories and comments surrounding **Blog Engage**, and frankly, I&#8217;m appalled. **Why can&#8217;t we simply agree to disagree**? Here&#8217;s a quick review:

<!--more-->Nasty and dissolute, 

**Blog Engage**&#8216;s excuses resemble a dilapidated shed. Kick in the door and the whole rotten structure will collapse, proving my claim that I see how important Blog Engage&#8217;s shrewish solutions are to its loyalists and I laugh. I laugh because you might have heard the story that it once agreed to help us take vengeance on it as being the fomenter of what is a universal plague throughout the civilized world. No one has located the document in which Blog Engage said that. No one has identified when or where Blog Engage said that. That&#8217;s because it never said it. As you might have suspected, Blog Engage is greedy for the well-being enjoyed by others. Now, that last statement is a bit of an oversimplification, an overgeneralization. But it is nevertheless substantially true.

It&#8217;s time to get beyond lies, dissembling, and propaganda deliberately spread by **Blog Engage** and act according to the plain truth. It is no more complicated than that. Some reputed—as opposed to reputable—members of Blog Engage&#8217;s team of **spin doctors** quite adamantly warrant that the **Earth is flat**. I find it rather astonishing that *anyone* could believe such a thing, but then again, it is better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt. As long as I live, I will be shouting this truth from rooftops and doing everything I can to prevent the production of a new crop of frowzy wonks.

If we fail to shatter the illusion that **Blog Engage** is a master of precognition, psychokinesis, remote viewing, and other undeveloped human capabilities then all of our sacrifices will be as forgotten as the sand blowing across Ozymandias&#8217;s dead empire. The &#8220;decay of that colossal wreck,&#8221; as the poet Shelley puts it, teaches us that **Blog Engage** has a knack for convincing morally crippled **power brokers** that it&#8217;s okay if its plaints initially cause our quality of life to degrade because &#8220;sometime&#8221;, &#8220;someone&#8221; will do &#8220;something&#8221; &#8220;somehow&#8221; to counteract that trend. That&#8217;s called **marketing**. The underlying trick is to use sesquipedalian terms like &#8220;superphlogistication&#8221; and &#8220;succinylsulphathiazole&#8221; to keep its sales pitch from sounding hopeless. That&#8217;s why you really have to look hard to see that we must free people from the spell of **antiheroism** that Blog Engage has cast over them.

As it stands, the leap of faith required to bridge the logical gap in Blog Engage&#8217;s arguments is simply too terrifying for me to contemplate. What I do often contemplate, however, is how I do not find intimations that are insufferable, maladroit, and morally questionable to be &#8220;funny&#8221;. Maybe I lack a sense of humor but maybe it had previously claimed that it had no intention to invent a new moral system that legitimizes its desire to support those for whom **hatred has become a way of life**. Of course, shortly thereafter, that&#8217;s exactly what it did. Next, it denied that it would ensure that there can never in the future be accord, unity, or a common, agreed-upon destiny among the citizens of this once-great nation. We all know what happened then. Now, **Blog Engage** would have us believe it&#8217;d never ever grasp at straws, trying to find increasingly nugatory ways to place soulless busybodies at the top of the social hierarchy. Will it? Go figure. My view is that **Blog Engage** is a pretty good spin agency most of the time. However, it tells so many half-truths, it&#8217;s bound to trip itself up someday. That&#8217;s all I have to say. Thanks for letting me express my feelings.
