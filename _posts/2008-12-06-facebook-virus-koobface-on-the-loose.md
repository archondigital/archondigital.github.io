The Koobface virus has been spreading around lately to Facebook users. It was detected as early as August but the virus continues to infect users all over popular social network.

This is the same cirus that infected MySpace users earlier this year. It infects users who open messages that appear to come from their friends.

The phoney messages are easy to detect, and if you think before you open messages, you'd know if a message did in fact come from a trusted source just by reading the subject line.

The messages from Koobface have subject lines like "You look so funny on our new video" or something like that. The body of this malicious message and contains a link to a fake video site. Clicking on the video or the play button will then ask the user to download an updated video plugin, which turns out to be malware.

As always the best practices are never open messages from unkown sources and to periodically change your password.

Follow your guts, **whenever there is any doubt**, **there is no doubt**.
