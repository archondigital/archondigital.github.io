So after my little adventure with Hardy Heron almost [three weeks ago][1], I can proudly say that my home PC is now a true-blue Linux box. Everyone at home now uses the OS for their browsing, e-mail and word processing duties. No complaints so far from my users at home. It seems they have <!--more-->adjusted pretty easily or don&#8217;t actually care whatever the operating system is as long as everything just works.

Almost everything I need is now running on the Ubuntu box. I used Wine to install my personal accounting software, Photoshop CS2 and Dreamweaver 8. I had a few minutes of using GIMP to edit and crop the picture on my [about][2] page but that was my only time to ever use the image editing software.

At the office, I still work on both a Mac and a Windows box for my real design work only because the existing workflow and everyone around me have yet to adjust. Also Creative Suite 3 apps don&#8217;t work yet with WINE. I know, life sucks, not everyone seems to be on the same level with me on this but that will soon change.

Working on the Linux command line has given me enough practice to be confident enough to actually setup my own slice at <a href="https://manage.slicehost.com/customers/new?referrer=1367440658" target="_blank">Slicehost</a>. This has been one of my goals ever since when I started out with Ubuntu.

My article on setting up my very first VPS will come next.
