If only he can come up with the "good idea" then he wouldn't be scanning the vastness of space and squeezing it dry just to get one.

The thought gets in archon's mind but perhaps it is the archon's way, his methodology when coming up with something new out of thin air. His way of getting ideas out without copying other people's work or without trying to repeat his own ideas.<!--more-->

Time is short and they only pay so much that thinking should not be an option.

Getting to cough up something half-baked or repeating an old idea has always been a sort of last resort for the overlord ever since he decided to take on his role as a lowly graphic designer. But due to time constraints archon has decided to pull up that new idea from his rotten old backpack of magic tricks.
