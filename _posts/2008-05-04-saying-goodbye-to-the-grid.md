I fell in love with the grid (gs) back when I signed up and up to the last minute. It was easy for me to ignore the issues with loading times, downtime and other problems as I was one happy customer. Mediatemple is family, but you just can&#8217;t stay at home for the rest of your life.

Before this article was written, Archon Digital took eons to fully load which I find to be really frustrating a lot of times. It has been on a Mediatemple Grid Server ever since the domain was bought in January 2007 and moving away from their lovely control panel was like moving away from home for the first time. <!--more-->

## Evolution by Choice

As far as I can tell, I&#8217;ve already outgrown the Grid. I&#8217;ve outgrown not the capability and limitations of the system, but more on what else I can do and learn from it. I craved for root access and the freedom of being able to fully configure my own server.

The next step was definitely going to be a VPS for me and back then I was choosing between <a href="http://mediatemple.net" target="_blank">Mediatemple</a>&#8216;s DV hosting and <a href="http://slicehost.net" target="_blank">Slicehost</a> VPS. The decision was made early last week, where I concluded that learning how to <a href="https://manage.slicehost.com/customers/new?referrer=1367440658" target="_blank">setup my own box from scratch</a> would be more beneficial to me in the long run.

I enjoyed using Mediatemple&#8217;s Grid Server (gs) hosting and have had good experience with their tech support and all their friendly staff as well. While there were indeed <a href="http://www.mediatemple.net/webhosting/gs/systemstatus.php" target="_blank">numerous outages</a>, I still consider Mediatemple a great hosting company and their upcoming Cluster Server (cs) will most probably a better successor to the Grid.

Other problems I encountered with the Grid were related to certain TXT DNS entries which I badly need for domainkeys and others to work.Â Those who regularly visit my site can probably tell the difference on how much the loading time has improved. From a previous 1.0 to 8.0 seconds to a speedy 0.56 seconds

## Why Not Shared?

You really can&#8217;t make me go back to shared hosting. I have nothing against it as it works real well for a lot of people, but I really feel more like I&#8217;ve outgrown it long ago. Even tried reseller hosting for a few sites last year but to me it&#8217;s still just shared hosting with a few added perks.

I also run a few other sites that require more resources and you would probably hate to be my neighbor in a shared hosting box.

## What Next?

So that&#8217;s about it. I just need to transfer a few sites off to another hosting account and will then officially close my grid server account. I have documented how I set up my NGINX setup and compiled most of the information on a new article which will be posted here soon.
