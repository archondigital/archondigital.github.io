Archon Digital began as my rant blog for every little evil thing I can think off after a long and stressful day at work. It has since included a few sneak peaks into my world and into the stuff I really am passionate about. This evolution has been for the good as there not many who would be interested on whether I took the freakin' train or if I squished someone while rushing to work.<!--more-->

The nature of my work and the stress it involves pretty much take a huge toll on my ability to write. Ideas and goals may have flourished but it seems most are physically impossible to meet and remain on the drawing board. 24 hours seems not enough for me, my passion and my work. I have to tell my body to stop working and actually find some time to physically rest.

My PR is down to zero after writing a few paid postings as an experiment back a few months ago. It doesn't matter to me at the moment and I'd also like to take advantage of it and make a some major changes to my site. I have been contemplating on whether I'd redirect all my traffic to archondigital.com and merge the two domains. Archondigital.com makes much more sense as it is easier to spell and recall without the dash in between while archon-digital.com is useful for me for a lot of other purposes.

The next few months will see a rebirth of my site with a new look and feel. Version 4 of Archon Digital is now in the drawing boards.
