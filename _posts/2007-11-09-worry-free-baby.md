![Steven](1)

Baby Steven now three (update: six months as of Feb. 09, 2008) months old. It took a while for me to start posting pictures mostly because we were sooooo busy at work and also because some tech guy accidentally erased all data from the computer where I originally placed all my baby photos from Steven's day 01 to present. Just managed to save a few pics from my mobile and made a quick upload to flickr.
</p>

I'm back to posting stuff after <del datetime="2007-11-09T15:32:53+00:00">weeks</del> months of working almost non-stop on a few projects that really took much of my time.

I just can't wait until thursday.
