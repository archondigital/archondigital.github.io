Almost everyday at work, we eat at this place (from where I was standing when I took this photo). The scene is almost the same everytime I am there. A vendor passing by while other people smoke, chat or have drinks after they finished eating.

Taken using a [Leica Summicron-M 1:2/35mm ASPH][6] lens at 1/500s f/8 ISO 500. [See image on Flickr][1]{:target="_blank"} for EXIF. Posted originally on my [Instagram][2]{:target="_blank"}.
