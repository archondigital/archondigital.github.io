A devotee making his way through the thick crowds. I encountered a lot of tired but determined faces throughout the day.

Took this while I was on a 35mm lens in a dimly lit part of the covered sidewalk, trying to get near a lamp post ahead to help secure my position and was my shooting my way through.

This is my first time to shoot during the [Feast of the Black Nazarene][4]. You may browse through my other entries from this event [here][4].

Taken using a [Leica Summicron-M 1:2/35mm ASPH][6] lens at 1/250s f/8 ISO 3200. [See image on Flickr][1]{:target="_blank"} for EXIF. <!-- Posted originally on my [Instagram][2]{:target="_blank"}. -->
