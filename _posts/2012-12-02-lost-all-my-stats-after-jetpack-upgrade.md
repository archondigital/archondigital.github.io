    Update: December 4, 2012 &#8211; Today at around 4:56pm, my support request was acknowledged by Valerie, a Happiness Engineer from WordPress.com. She said that they have located the source of the problem and have asked one of their engineers to take a look.

A little over a week ago, I was doing my usual chores updating and running some checks on websites I was working on and later checked my own site, [Archon Digital][1].

The following morning after updating my plugins , I checked out the WordPress for iOS app on my iPhone to see some of JetPacks new features like their new mobile theme and ran a few tests, browsing through my website on a mobile theme before switching that feature off. I went on to check my stats from my iPhone 4S, which required me to &#8220;re-connect&#8221; my WordPress.com account to the iOS app. Right after that I realized that my stats which was there from 2007 to present, was all gone and all I had was stats for the past two days.

I haven&#8217;t checked my stats the previous day from right after I upgraded, so it was just after I &#8220;re-connected&#8221; my WordPress.com account to iOS that I saw the problem.

Immediately after that, I entered a [support request][2] on the WordPress.org forums under the Troubleshooting forum and waited for a reply.

An entire week has passed and I still have had no response from anyone from the people involved with JetPack or WordPress. I find this disappointing, as I&#8217;ve seen enough posts in that forum getting addressed or at least acknowledged by a mod within hours or within a few days. Going through the forums also revealed several similar issues with some workaround offered but those were from three years back and I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re still relevant.

This should be a cause for alarm, as I also use JetPack on some government websites that I maintain and updating JetPack on them might cause me to lose the statistics that I&#8217;ve tracked from 2010.

I&#8217;m still hoping their staff is just swamped with requests and mine will get addressed when the right person happens to see it. Those were stats from when I started this website in 2007 and it feels really terrible to have lost all that from a simple bug.

My only consolation is that I have Google Analytics installed on all my websites and I&#8217;m now also exploring other self-hosted open source solutions like Piwik.
