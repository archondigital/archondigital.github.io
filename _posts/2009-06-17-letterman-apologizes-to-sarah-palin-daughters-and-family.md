David Letterman apologized on air this June 15th to Sarah Palin her daughters and the rest of their family in an effort to hopefully end the controversy surrounding the joke that he said a few days ago on his show regarding the Alaska governor's daughter. The entire situation has gone from coarse joke to a national campaign by conservatives to hold Letterman responsible and account for his wrong deeds. The newly formed advocacy group firedavidletterman.com has called for Letterman to be fired from CBS even went as far as staging a rally in front of Ed Sullivan Theatre where the Lateshow is taped.

The longtime Lateshow host started his show with this quip aimed at the ongoing Fire David Letterman rally outside Ed Sulivan Theatre.

"Now when I call your name, please come forward and pick up your apology. [Laughter, applause] I wanna get through this as quickly as possibly so you folks can get to the 'Fire Dave Rally.' [Cheering] It's nice that people hate me who are no longer just part of my immediate family. My son, he's telling everybody at school that his father is Conan!"

His apology was straighforward and did not point to any other party and after that the show went on and was as hilarious as ever.

>I would like to apologize, especially to the two daughters involved, Bristol and Willow, and also to the governor and her family and everybody else who was outraged by the joke. I'm sorry about it and I'll try to do better in the future.

He also stated that his intent was indeed meaningles nevertheless the perception was the one that caused public outrage and that he is taking full responsibility for his actions.
