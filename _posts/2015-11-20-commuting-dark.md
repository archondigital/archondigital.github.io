A visually-impared, elderly man and his guide waits for a bus along EDSA in the late evening. This was taken  during the just recently concluded APEC Ministerial and Economic Leaders' meetings held in [Manila][4] from November 16 to 19.

Night street photography can be very frustrating if you don't have gear and glass that can take pictures in very low light situations. It has been a few days since I got the [Sony A7SII][5], and I am still very much impressed by its low-light capabilities and its in-body, image stabilization. This image was shot handheld, in near low light and at very slow shutter speeds.

Taken using a [Leica Summicron-M 1:2/35mm ASPH][6] lens at 1/10s f/8 ISO 3200. [See image on Flickr][1]{:target="_blank"} for EXIF. <!-- Posted originally on my [Instagram][2]{:target="_blank"}. -->
