Rock n' Roll! Yeah! Happy Metal for all ya happy chums out there!

Now after hearing the original head-banging Metallica classic and the Richard Cheese big band version, here comes a "smooth jazz" cover from Andy Rehfeldt.<!--more-->

I am still wondering what software he used to isolate the vocal track. There's more of Andy's work on his [Youtube Channel][1] and go ahead and add this genius on [Twitter][2].

Can't really stop myself from letting out a wicked laugh every time I see this video.
