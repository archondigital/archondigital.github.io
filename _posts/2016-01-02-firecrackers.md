		<p class="lead">Spent new year's eve in our place in Malate and briefly took to the streets at exactly 12:00 midnight just as firecrackers in our street started going off.</p>

		<p>2015 was a good year in general. I met new people, <a href="http://ten88.digital/" target="_blank">launched a startup</a>, and learned much from the past year's experiences and is looking forward to a better one this 2016.</p>

		<p>This will also be my last 180 days of working on the <a href="http://www.gov.ph/" target="_blank">Official Gazette</a> and <a href="http://data.gov.ph/" target="_blank">Open Data PH</a>.</p>

		<p>We get to vote for a new president and other leaders in the next few months, I'm hoping we'd all make the right choices and vote based on principle and conviction. In the end, we get to vote who we deserve.</p>

		<p>And hopefully, George RR Martin will finish his freakin' book this time around.</p>
