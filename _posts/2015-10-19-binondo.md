I went for a brief walk in Chinatown with a friend last August and captured this young man pulling an overloaded cart as I was about to sit down on a bench. Carts like these are the lifeblood of businesses in this district. It also appears most of these workers appear to be minors or out-of-school youth, too young to have to endure heavy labor and should be in school.
