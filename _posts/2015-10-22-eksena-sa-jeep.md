Jeepney passenger at the intersection of San Andres St. corner Osme√±a Ave., Manila.

This post is the first in my [Humans of San Andres Bukid][3] and [Commuting in Manila][5] series, a subset of my [Streets of Manila][4] set of images.

Taken with a Sony A6000 and a Nikon Nikkor 50mm f/1.2 AI-S lens at 1/125s f/2.8 ISO 125. [See image on Flickr][1]{:target="_blank"} for EXIF.
