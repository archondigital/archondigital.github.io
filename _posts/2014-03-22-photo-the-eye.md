excerpt: "It's like a giant cyclops from an alternate dimension, a single robotic eyeball looking down on us little people below, watching our every move. No, this is not the set of a movie on fictional dystopian societies, the photo is actually the ceiling artwork in the Mabini Hall of the Department of Foreign Affairs in Pasay City."

I am trying to find out the name of the artist that created this impressive piece of art. This image was taken during a briefing for the Diplomatic Corps on the [Foreign Aid Transparency Hub][1] using an Apple iPhone 5 and post processed using Photoshop.
