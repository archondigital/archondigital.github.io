<p class="lead">Last October 9, 2008 Archon Digital launched a campaign both as a cause oriented post for awareness against exploitation of Filipina women as well as an SEO experiment to drive traffic to this site by maximizing for keywords related to Pinay Scandal.</p>

The results were quite impressive as up to today the particular post has been a constant source of traffic for Archon Digital. It is also quite interesting to note that the Pinay Scandal post has one of the lowest bounce rates for content on my site.

I haven't had time to get into specific metrics but a steady stream of traffic from 60 to 100 daily from search engines would always be welcome. I know this is still a small amount compared to most of the other Pinay Scandal articles out in the blogosphere but even so, considering I joined the Pinay Scandal bandwagon this late in the game, I am happy with the results. This Pinay Scandal SEO experiment by Marhil Macuha continously brings traffic to a lot of Pinoy blogs.

The campaign has taught me well on how to write better keyword optimized articles which attract a steadier stream of traffic from search engines. I'm now into exploring more keyword rich articles which will also attract a certain level of search engine traffic.

This doesn't take me away from my goal of helping generate awareness and get all those sex scandals, adult dating, pornographic sites using Pinay as their keyword off the front page of Google. These types of articles do not in any way help in improving the world's perception of a true Filipina or Pinay for that matter.

An online buddy of mine also published his own pinay scandal account. A rite of passage for the Pinoy blogger as he put it. Check out bendzg's pinay scandal article.
