This post is part of my [Humans of San Andres Bukid][3] series. I live nearby, I see this everyday. This is home.

Photographed in the streets of San Andres Bukid, Manila. The thoughts and words that accompany this image are mere works of fiction, fueled by lack of sleep and much over-thinking.

Taken with a Sony A6000 with a Leica Summicron-M 1:2/35mm ASPH at 1/200s f/8 ISO 3200. [See image on Flickr][1]{:target="_blank"} for EXIF. Originally posted on my [Instagram][2]{:target="_blank"}.
