The Arroyo government has just started its assault (approximately around 4:01pm) on the group of Sen. Trillianes and Gen. Lim who have forcibly taken over Manila Peninsula after marching out of a courtroom session in Makati RTC earlier this morning.

Government forces are also reported to have tried to gain access to our facilities, no confirmation though and I don't know how and if our hotel security would be able to prevent them from taking such action but at the moment the hotel is filled with helpless civilians, hotel guests and some of those who were evacuated from the Pen earlier. It would be wise if the military would spare this building from being used as a vantage point for their snipers should the violence escalate any further.

News footage shows an armored personnel carrier forcing its way into the lobby of the newly-renovated Manila Peninsula. Poor old mighty Pen.
