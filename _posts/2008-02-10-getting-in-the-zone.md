Writing has been very elusive to me lately. Working long hours has been draining but fun at the same time and I can&#8217;t seem to blame anyone but myself for getting the writer&#8217;s block.

The following video is a perfect example on Archon&#8217;s sentiments whenever he finds it hard to finish a post.

## It brings back a lot of fun memories for me.

Too bad the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hunt_%28puppeteer%29" target="_blank">voice behind</a> the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Music" target="_blank">puppet (Don Music)</a> died from AIDS back in 1979.

Trying to get back in the zone has been a long but totally cool ride for me. It started with the Re-Design of this site back from a few weeks ago. Getting my CSS and wordpress loops to work well together did take a lot of time.

It might take some time for me to build up my traffic to a healthier level. Probably when I start to improve my posting habits and start cranking up some free themes for downloading.
