<p class="lead">It's literally the most famous painting in the world as no other painting is visited by throves of tourists that line up all day and push against each other, just to catch a glimpse, or take an obligatory selfie, of this masterpiece of Leonardo da Vinci.</p>

But honestly, I was more amused with the idea of taking photos of the people crowding the Mona Lisa than taking photos of the painting itself. It was nearly impossible to get a decent picture of it as it is enclosed in a thick, bullet-proof glass structure designed to protect it from theft, vandals and the elements.
