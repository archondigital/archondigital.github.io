Me and a friend were going through this vinyl dealer&#8217;s collection of records when I ran into this marvelous piece printed artwork. It&#8217;s a 12&#8243; vinyl album cover from a trip-hop group called Faithless. The printing on the album cover appears to have been a two-color process run on a traditional offset printer which was perfect for the duotone artwork that featured a classic photograph of Muhammad Ali. They must&#8217;ve used a dark blue spot color and process black on the uncoated stock to create this nice duotone effect. Disclaimer: I did not have my tiny lens with me and I wasn&#8217;t able to check it out real close, so I might be mistaken with all the specs. Anyway, I almost bought this record for myself, just because of the album cover, even if I wasn&#8217;t into trip-hop and even if I haven&#8217;t got myself a working record player at home right now.<figure class="figure alignnone">

I&#8217;ve always said that I started out in print, and though I may have my feet firmly planted in web design, tech and other digital media, printing will always remain special to me. I scoured the net looking for information on who designed the artwork and the printer who ran the job but couldn&#8217;t find that information. If you happen to know, please inform me so I could give the proper credit.

Offset lithography was probably one of the best innovations to come out of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Some say that print is a dying industry, but I still refuse to accept that. It&#8217;s possible that traditional offset lithography and the letterpress will turn out like vinyl records which, even in the age of iTunes and digital formats, are still being collected and adored by a lot of enthusiasts.
