There was a short delay to my posting of the results for the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/v5/internet/contest/i-hate-mondays/" target="_self">I Hate Mondays</a> contest as I had a terrible headache yesterday. I&#8217;m actually not feeling very well today but I know I should be posting the results right now.

So here it is&#8230;<!--more-->

Congratulations to [Search Engine Panel][1] you have won the main prize of **2000** Entrecard Credits. Also to [Kent][2] and to [Popular Wealth][3] for winning the secondary prize of **500** Entrecard credits each.

This is the first time I attempted a contest of my own and I was very happy with the results.

The prizes were raffled using <a href="http://www.random.org" target="_blank">Random.org</a>&#8216;s integer generator and since we only had five entries to the contest, I have decided to give away 300 Entrecard credits to all participants of the game. Everybody wins and Mondays still suck. <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/v5/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
