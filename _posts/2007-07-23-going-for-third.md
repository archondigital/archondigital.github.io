<blockquote><p class="lead">Why just two when you can have all three?</p></blockquote>

We're expecting our third child sometime next month.

According to the latest ultrasound results my wife will be due by Aug 24 hopefully she makes it to giving birth on that date as the doctor said she might give birth earlier due to some very early signs of labor pains that she was complaining about last week and a few days ago.

The doc gave her a shot for the baby just in case he (ultrasound confirms it's a boy!) gets wacky and decides to come out early.
