<p class="lead">Capitol Commoners braving the rain to get a ride home.</p>

I've been stuck in the vicinity of Capitol Commons in Pasig since 9:00pm due to that day's traffic gridlock. And since I'm already soaked and bored, I took out my camera, wrapped it with a rain cover and started shooting.

Uber was at x5 surge pricing and so was Grabcar. I got home at 2:00am, feverish and exhausted.

Taken using a [MC Jupiter-37A 135mm f/3.5 KMZ][7] lens at 1/100s f/3.5 ISO 6400 on a [Sony A7SII][5]. [See image on Flickr][1]{:target="_blank"} for EXIF. Posted originally on my [Instagram][2]{:target="_blank"}.
