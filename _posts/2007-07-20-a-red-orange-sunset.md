Another workday has ended, but the overlord still doesn't want to leave his post. He glances at the red-orange sunset and senses the impending rush of all the other primitive lifeforms around him. They all wish to retreat to their so called "homes".

It seems the overlord also wishes unwind and relax in his lair but refrains from doing so as he refuses to join this rat race called the "rush". He reasons with himself if he should unleash his powers of flight to get ahead this mob but later decides not to.<!--more-->

The overlord then decides to sit down at his workstation and wait for the right time to leave. Then an SMS comes through his mobile phone, he deciphers the encrypted message from his wife which read as "Uwi k ng maaga, lgi k n lng ginagabi".

Suddenly the overlord overcomes his disgust for joining the evening "rush" and decides to take the train home.
