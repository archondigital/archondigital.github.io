<p class="lead">I've already seen this video a couple of times, shared it in the past on my FB and on Twitter but it's still, hands down, the best cover done for this song by Tool.</p>

These kids are all students of [Aaron O'Keefe][1] and their other recordings can be downloaded for free here: [https://aaronokeefe.bandcamp.com/][2]
