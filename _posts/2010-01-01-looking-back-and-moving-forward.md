The year 2009 was a year that has seen so many changes in my life and career. Changes that introduced new challenges, and challenges that made me reflect on things I normally do not reflect on.

It began with me working for a new company in a foreign country, observing and learning a foreign culture. Being a pioneer in a company that had grandiose plans for the United Kingdom, Middle East and the rest of the world had you face different and exciting challenges on a daily basis. Learning new things and meeting new faces as I went along, work was going along just fine if not for the economic crisis.

Exciting as it was, I experienced first-hand the choices in life that an OFW makes on a daily basis. Moving away from the family to work as part of oneâ€™s goal to conquer the world did not work out as intended. Being homesick and disconnected, the situation has taken its toll both emotionally and physically on me and my family.

I had to make a choice between career and family and I chose the later.

Now, I am fortunately still working for the same outfit but now in a much better situation being with the family I love and work so much hard for.

2010 presents itself to me as a great year with another plethora of choices of which I will face head on. This year will be a prosperous one as great things happen to those who think of and believe in great things.
