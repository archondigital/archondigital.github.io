Like in a science fiction film when a small town suddenly becomes alien infested and starts abducting the locals where you'd find people who used to talk like normal people say "Don't Pay for White Teethâ€¦" or something else on that same robotic tone.

Personally, I don't like advertisements on Tweets as it destroys the purpose of what tweeting is all about. Let me know your thoughts on this whether you think advertising on tweets is okay or not.

I remember a few months ago I was toying with the idea that [Microblogging][1] was all part of a grand conspiracy and that Twitter was turning us into a horde of mindless thumbs thumbing away on our mobile phones with every single thought that came through.

My twitter experience began in 2007 and has since been fun for the most part tweeting stuff between people you know and back and forth. Now fast forward to 2009 with all the third-party tools and gadgets making Twitter into a very powerful platform. [Tweetdeck][3] and [Tweetboard][4] are my Twitter tools of choice as if allows me to communicate with more people faster and with much ease.

The recent addition of the lists feature has also kept me occupied trying to organize my followers and synchronize them with my Tweetdeck columns and tweet away on the Tweetboard on my site and see how the backlinks would help in the long run. I'm no marketing guru but to having a lot of Twitter followers gives you a big marketing advantage. It empowers you and allows you to do all sorts of powerful things to your Twitter feed and that includes the option of auto-tweeting paid ads.

It's still a no for me, putting automated tweets with advertising, but I would be glad to hear your thoughts on this.
