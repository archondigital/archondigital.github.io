Philippine politics and open source CMS WordPress cannot seem to create good code poetry. Perhaps poetry and political harmony (read; anarchy) cannot and will never co-exist to create a dynamic Filipino WordPress community.

I’ve been going through my rounds on the WordPress support forums for the past few days and all I see is code at the moment. Bundle in local evening news on Philippine television and you get the following results.

Look at this, I keep getting errors on this “if statement”…

~~~~~~~~
if $Gloria = $evil;
(
else if ($Gloria = 'Lakas&Kampi&CMD');
else if ($Ampatuan = '&Gloria');
else if ($Gibo = 'Lakas&Kampi&CMD');
else if ($Gibo = 'forum-trolls,facebook-trolls,twitter-trolls');
then Gloria = ('Gibo');
endwhile;
)
~~~~~~~~

I can’t seem to finish the statement keeps saying

~~~~~~~~
'function EO error 464'
~~~~~~~~
