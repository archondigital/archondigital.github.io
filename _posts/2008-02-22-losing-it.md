I finally got myself into a weight management program. This decision was long overdue and was finally made into a workable three-month program. It is being run by the company I work for as part of their wellness program for employees and management.

There is a tiny twist to the program as it will be run like a reality show similar to the show Biggest Loser. First weigh in will be on Tuesday (February 26, 2008).<!--more-->Right now I am more than 30 lbs. overweight my height is 6&#8242; 2 1/2&#8243; and I roughly weigh 245 lbs. My weight fluctuates anywhere from 230 &#8211; 245 lbs depending on the season. I should be somewhere between 190 &#8211; 210 lbs to be considered fit. It is a breakthrough for me to even sign up for the program. The past year had me put a lot of thought into managing my weight problem, even had a few complimentary gym memberships but never really made an effort to do something physically about my excess fat and weight.

Reading the weight-loss blog of <a href="http://www.saphrym.com/blog/" target="_blank">Saphrym</a> also served as an inspiration. It helped me to finally decide to take part in the program which by coincidence is being launched next week.

Archon Digital will eventually cover highlights of the program as well as feature those who will make significant progress in the coming weeks.
