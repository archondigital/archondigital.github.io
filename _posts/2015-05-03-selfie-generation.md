The image is from one of the solo photowalks that I took sometime back in March. It was on a weekend when I had nothing better to do but walk around with a camera and creep strangers out. Spent that entire day taking pictures and just sort of forgot about these until today.

I thought maybe I could rant a bit about how everyone does selfies, but nah, that subject has already been well covered by almost everyone else I follow, so I'll just leave this photo here.

Taken while probably sitting down and resting using a Nikkor 50mm f/1.2 AI-S on an A6000. Black and white post-processing was done on Lightroom. [See image on Flickr][1] for EXIF. Posted originally on my [Instagram][2].
