**Late post:** Started the day early since it was the 4th day of the Papal visit and was anticipating thick crowds and closed streets. There was a slight drizzle and people were using the lenght of the LRT along Taft avenue as a giant covered walkway.

All available entrances to LRT stations along Taft avenue were full that morning so I ended up walking, and taking photos. I was able to walk a total of 11km that day according to the Moves app on my phone. 11km makes for a lot of photos and I'm still sifting through my files from these dates.

Taken while making my way into the dense crowd using a Sony SEL50F18 1:1.8/50mm lens on an A6000. Black and white post-processing was done on Lightroom. [See image on Flickr][1] for EXIF. Posted originally on my [Instagram][2].
