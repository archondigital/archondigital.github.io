## Yes, I hate Mondays.

From waking up early to taking the train to work, working and getting back home, the whole day seems to just run on <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0389860/" target="_blank">autopilot</a> for me. For the others around me, it&#8217;s like I have this big &#8220;F*ck-off-it&#8217;s-Monday&#8221; sign on my forehead.

Do you know what I find worse than getting up on a Monday morning?<!--more--> It&#8217;s getting up on a Sunday morning dreading that tomorrow will be a Monday.

And because I hate Mondays so much, I am giving away a total of 3000 Entrecard credits in prizes.

I&#8217;d would have loved to have a poll and find out what you guys think but I guess a little comment raffle would be more fun.

## Comment and Win a total of 3000 Entrecard Credits

Drop by and comment for a chance to win a total of 3000 Entrecard credits.Â To join, just answer the following question&#8230;

> What do you love or love-to-hate about Mondays?

Due to the time difference I will count all entries from now to until Entrecard&#8217;s next reset tomorrow. I will close off the commenting and will then raffle off the one 2000ec and two 500ec prizes to three lucky commenters and post the results.
