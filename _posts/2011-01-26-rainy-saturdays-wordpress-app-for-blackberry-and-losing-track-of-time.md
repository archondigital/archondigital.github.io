It was raining that Saturday night and I couldn’t get a ride home from the mall as there were just too many people all trying to get a cab at the same time. I was virtually stuck where I was so I decided go back inside, grab some coffee and tinker with this WordPress’ app for Blackberry.

You see, [shopping malls](http://foursquare.com/archondigital/checkin/4d3176b098336dcbcb6c18f0) are designed so well in a certain way that people are mislead into having a false sense of time and dimension. The walkways are wider, walls are farther apart, the ceiling much higher than normal and most are painted using a warm and cozy shade that helps you to lose track of the outside world. Time seems to run much slower when inside the mall that you actually find yourself lost in an elaborate labyrinth of boutiques and food stops, oddities and necessities all backed up by clever marketing boldly claiming that you can actually save up through spending your hard-earned money.

By the time the outside world catches up on you, your day and precious time is forever lost.

An entire week has passed since I downloaded the app but since our team was buried in a ton of work I never had any chance to try it and actually publish something. Friends told me how easy it was to use the WordPress app and with me being the newbie to this world of walking thumbs, I just could not resist not to try it for myself. So here I am thumbing away at this app.

A few days later I find this draft post still on my Blackberry, waiting patiently to be published by its author. The interface works pretty well but I just realized I haven’t really written anything about the WordPress app for BlackBerry. Fun.
