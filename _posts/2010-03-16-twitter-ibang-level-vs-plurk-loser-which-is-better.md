This idea has always been bugging me for quite some time now and though I have my own opinion about it I&#8217;d still want to ask you people which is better, **Plurk or Twitter**?

<!--more-->For the past year or so, I&#8217;ve always tried to get along with Plurk but sadly I just felt it wasn&#8217;t the app for me. With Twitter, I find it more rewarding being a blogger in terms of traffic and also in connecting with people in a closer way. But this is just me and I&#8217;m no social marketing expert and definitely not claiming to be one. I&#8217;m more interested in real users with real human opinions on this subject.

And sorry for [Kris vs. Ruffa][1] line up there, I know it&#8217;s been a week already but it just made a perfect fit. The idea came from this image [I found on tumblr][2] that same week. Check it out.
