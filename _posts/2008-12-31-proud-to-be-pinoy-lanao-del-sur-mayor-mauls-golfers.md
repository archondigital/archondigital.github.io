excerpt: "A public servant with an overblown ego and mindless henchmen takes part in a demolition job of his own career after mauling a 56-year-old man and his son right in front of their daughter over a round of golf. Now, aren't we all just 'Proud to be Pinoy' now?"

After talking about being [feeling good to be Pinoy][1], it seems that some have had worse experiences right in my own beloved homeland where fellowmen are being harassed by my own Filipino-elected public servants. I just read about it from the article, <del>A Bad Round of Golf by JaypeeOnline</del>, where he wrote about the plight of Bambee de la Paz, her father and brother who got beat up to a pulp by Nasser Pangandaman Jr., a Mayor from Lanao Del Sur.

My deepest sympathies to the family of this young girl and I am pledging my support to make this cruelty known more to the Filipino public and to the rest of the world.

This is not a rare incident where a public official went violent, mauled, harrassed or even raped a law-abiding citizen. Public officials like this have no right to take part in ruling our country. I am ashamed of the conduct of this public official who would let out all that anger and violence over a round of golf.

Would anyone of you elect such a public servant? Now that 2010 is fast approaching us, things like this are more bound to happen as more public servants will get exposed and publicized for their deeds. Now if you are a public official like Mayor Nasser Pangandaman Jr, think first before you act and think of your duty to the country to its citizenry and not of your overblown egos.

Here is a link to the original blog post, [Vicissitude: The world has gone crazy][3], and some more related articles to this incident.
