Yep, that&#8217;s for real, I am the nephew of a very lovely person named *Malu Fernandez*. My aunt&#8217;s reputation though, is nowhere near the vilified persona much less the body mass (BMI) of the much hated, ex-People Asia writer. My aunt instead is an angel busy with making the world a much better place.

> My aunt&#8230; an angel busy with making the world a much better place.

I just read an article on <a href="http://joanjoyce.com/blog/?p=294" target="_blank">joanjoyce</a>&#8216;s blog and wanting to make a comment, I immediately jumped right in. But when I noticed that I was already typing away nearly three paragraphs worth of comments, I instead decided to make this into a full-pledged post.

*Malu Fernandez* (the writer, not my aunt) has come up with yet <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=goodLife2_mar10_2008" target="_blank">another article</a> which we think would cause another stir within the Pinoy blogosphere. <!--more-->I&#8217;m surprised 

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">she now</span> (don&#8217;t really care about which paper) she still writes for *Manila Standard Today* and I hope she enjoys working there. So here&#8217;s my reaction to her &#8220;<a href="http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=goodLife2_mar10_2008" target="_blank">slacking off</a>&#8221; commentary.

I took up journalism in college but ended up as a designer. Back then I felt that I didn&#8217;t need to &#8220;study&#8221; journalism as I grew up knowing that journalists are made and not taught. Being born and raised in a family full of journalists, I was never taught or made to write with such prejudice or bias.

*Malu Fernandez* may be correct with some of the facts particularly about *Pinoy bloggers* &#8220;**lynch blogging**&#8221; her for what she has written before. But to single out Filipinos as backstabbing *indios* with blogs, well that is a different case.

> &#8220;The difference between a **journalist** and a **blogger** is that journalists have to adhere to certain guidelines that govern the **freedom of speech**.&#8221;

True. A *journalist* abides by a certain **etiquette**, a non-written **code of conduct** when writing. A &#8220;pro&#8221; doesn&#8217;t speak out her mind without showing a plethora of facts. Journalists do not write articles that demean other people&#8217;s professions or livelihoods. They write about the **truth** and not about their egos.

On the other hand, us *bloggers* have a more liberal environment which I mostly enjoy. Here we can write on anything we want with no editors looking after <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">your</span> our writing skills and our biased ego. However &#8220;pro-blogging&#8221; demands that we evolve into something better either by writing good responsible content, fostering friendships, collaborating or networking with other bloggers.

## We bloggers are masters of our own domain, literally.

The article seems incomplete and her writing clearly shows her bias and that she was very much affected by the whole **OFW** fiasco last year. For me She is a feature writer and not a news person or journalist.

> &#8220;If you have something to say, don’t hide behind a false name. It’s just plain cowardice of you to do so.&#8221;

Journalists use pen names or pseudonyms to hide their identities. I know people who write for several major newspapers using different pen names for each publication. Even *Jose Rizal* and the rest of the gang used pen names to hide their identities from the Spaniards.

A *blogger&#8217;s* anonymity is purely cosmetic and is very limited. In most cases, trying a reverse IP lookup or a domain whois search will reveal who that anonymous *blogger* is along with an address and phone number.
