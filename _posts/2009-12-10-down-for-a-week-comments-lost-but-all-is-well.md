It has been almost a week since I turned off Archon Digital from public view mainly because of two really important things I had to do. First was that the MySQL database of the site was damaged beyond repair and has been in an unusable state since mid September 2009 due to problems related me having improperly uninstalling WP-Supercache at some point while trying out some new plugins.

Second, was to finally upload [version 5][1] of Archon Digital which has been ready and has been put on hold since the end of August 2009. Everything has also been put on hold for a few more days as the kids got the flu and I had my hands tied between work and the kids.

While I'm finally happy that I was able to restore the site to a working state, a lot of comments were never recovered and to me it was a lot of really great conversations made in the past nine months.
