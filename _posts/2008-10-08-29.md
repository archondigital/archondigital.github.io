## Happy Birthday to Me!

Today marks another year of learning and enjoying all the things that life has to offer.

A perfect time to reflect on my present status, my faith and also reviewing my personal and career goals. God has been kind to me and has always been there to keep me strong and to occassionally bail me out whenever I f#@k things up.

I've made no plans yet for tonight but let's see maybe a simple dinner for two with my wife would be a nice way to spend my evening.

Later today, I'm giving away 3,000 Entrecard credits to three lucky Entrecard members who drops on my site on the day of my birthday (October 8). They will receive their credits a week apart as Entrecard only allows credit transfers up to 1000ec.
