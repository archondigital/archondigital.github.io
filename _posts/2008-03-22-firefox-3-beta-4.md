<p>Just this morning I installed the latest beta from Mozilla Firefox. This is the first time I am installing the beta to give it a road test. Since I first started using it, I immediately noticed how faster the beta is as compared to the current version and it appears to not consume too much memory.</p>
<p>Here is a brief review some of the good points that Firefox 3 has to offer.</p>
<p><span class="attention">UPDATE 2008/06/18: <a href="http://archon-digital.com/studio/software/firefox-3-download-day-setting-a-new-world-record/">Firefox 3 has been officially launched</a>.</span></p>
<p>The following were observations made while using Firefox 3 for the first time. I refrained from writing about all the other technicalities as I saw that these were enough to convince me to switch from Firefox 2.</p>
<h2>User Interface</h2>
<p>It now gives you the ability to zoom the entire page or just the text, along with the much important quick reset shortcut (Ctrl+0). You wouldn&#8217;t believe how important this is to me when reading very tiny text used by some bloggers.</p>
<h2>Smart Bookmarks.</h2>
<p>A location bar and auto-bookmarker that is algorithm based, which provides better matches against your history and bookmarks for URLs and page titles. This makes surfing much more convenient for me.</p>
<h2>Plenty of Performance Improvements</h2>
<p>From what I read in the release notes, changes to the JavaScript engine and a profile guided optimization resulted in a dramatic improvement over the previous releases particularly when using web applications such as Google Mail, Google Apps and Zoho. I fired up my Google Apps and opened a few other sites and got convinced that indeed the new features are for real.</p>
<p>Improvements on memory usage was a big plus to me. I observed that Firefox 3 seems to actively cut usage of RAM whenever I it is idle. I kept task manager open for a while where I was able to observe how Firefox 3 drastically reduces the amount of memory being consumed when browsing.</p>
<p>Here is a full screenshot of how much memory it consumes while dropping on Entrecard.</p>
<p><a title="Firefox 3 Beta 4" href="http://archon-digital.com/wp-content/screenshot.jpg"><img src="http://archon-digital.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/screenshot.jpg" alt="Firefox 3 Beta 4" /></a><br />
On this screenshot, I have three windows open, one for regular surfing and admin tasks (8 tabs), for dropping on Entrecard (9 tabs), iTunes (playing Richard Cheese) and my trusty ole&#8217; Photoshop with it&#8217;s own set of open tasks. Before this same set of apps amounted to almost 380MB of RAM on Firefox 2. Version 3 uses only 123MB of RAM. Take note that I am not on a fast system (like in the office) as this is just the regular PC I let everyone else use at home.</p>
<h2>Add-ons</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, not everyone on my list of add-ons like Alexa&#8217;s Sparky, Google Toolbar and Linky were compatible with the latest beta. I felt a sign of relief as I was able to retain Web Developer toolbar, Fireshot and Stylish which are essential tools in my daily tasks.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The entire experience led me to realize that I was wasting too much of my resources on Firefox 2. Safari may seem faster than Firefox 2, but I don&#8217;t really think that Apple&#8217;s engineers were able to make it a very secure browser for Windows users.</p>
<p>I am not much of a GUI person when working on Windows and I keep every piece of eyecandy disabled and work with as minimum resources as possible. Anyway, there&#8217;s  always the Mac Pro at work to give me all the Eyecandy I crave for.</p>
<p>This Firefox user (not much love for IE) can&#8217;t wait until the stable version is released.</p>
