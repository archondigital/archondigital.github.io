<p>After a few weeks of trying to find some free time to finally work on this site, ArchonDigital ver.3.0 is now live on the world wide web.</p>
<p>Work on this new theme design started immediately after posting &#8220;<a href="http://archondigital.com/2008/01/04/needs-a-re-design/">Needs a Re-design</a>&#8220;. The new design is still only 90% finished for as of this writing, there are still a lot of kinks being worked out on the comments, pages, custom pages and some other soon to be discovered bugs (human coding errors, yes I still admit I am human)<!--more--></p>
<p>Please do comment and critique the new look. Archon is open to any reactions and comparisons with regards to the old theme which is uploaded as an image as seen below</p>
