Since the middle of 2013, I've been exploring Content Management Systems that I could use to simplify the way I maintain blogs and small websites. I came across various flat file, lightweight, content management systems and wondered if I could create my own. The main goal is for me to create a lightweight CMS, whether flat file or on lightweight DB that I can use for myself and my clients. Part of that is learning Jekyll and Liquid which I found very useful in other working on other projects.

I've used WordPress on my main website/blog, [Archon Digital]({{ site.baseurl }}), since 2007. There's around a dozen WordPress instances that I maintain, all with various levels of customization, including a theme that is being implemented across [government websites](/projects/govph). I also have other websites running on Drupal and there's also my little experiment with Ghost on [Pinapaitan](http://pinapaitan.com).

Don't get me wrong, I love working on WordPress, I've learned a great deal in the years I've been using it for work and for personal projects, but I fear that I've grown too comfortable with it and now I feel it is time that I move on and learn something new.
