Anti David Letterman supporters will rally tomorrow (June 16, 2009) in front of the Ed Sullivan where the Lateshow is being taped as a statement against the jokes made by David Letterman against Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and her daughters.

It would seem that Lateshow host David Letterman's jokes about Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's daughters is not just about to die a natural death anytime soon. A website created by conservative author Michael Patrick Leahy, firedavidletterman.com, is spreading like wildfire accross the internet and is seen as being used by the right wing conservatives as a means to get back on David Letterman who is a democrat and has, for the longest time, been notorious for his jokes against Republicans.

These conservatives have taken the situation to an entirely new level and is now calling for a boycott of anything related to the Lateshow. They aim to hit them where it hurts by creating all this publicity against the Lateshow's host to pressure the advertisers to pull out from their regular advertisment slots. As of this moment, public relations people from the company's identified are announcing either they intend or have already pulled out advertising on the CBS website and on the show itself.

David Letterman's call for a meeting and his "apology" has

Palin's responded with this statement

> "The Palins have no intention of providing a ratings boost for David Letterman by appearing on his show. Plus, it would be wise to keep [14 year old] Willow away from David Letterman."

## Masters of Spin

Though the jokes were done in poor taste, the entire situation is has been manipulated in a way to reflect the worst in David Letterman. The entire fiasco has become more of a partisan thing than a crusade against joking about young teens being subject of a sexual assault. These masters of spin are all behind the theatrics and puppetry of the entire show and the masses are all in it for a ride.

We can only sit back and watch as the events unfold and see if the puppet masters will have their way.
