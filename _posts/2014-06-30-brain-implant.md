<p class="lead">A microchip implanted in the brain of a paralyzed man in this video proved successful and has allowed him to regain movement in his right hand using only his thoughts.</p>

The cutting-edge technology is called [Neurobridge][2] and has allowed Ian Burkhart, a 23-year old patient from Brooklyn who figured in a diving accident in 2010, to regain movement in his hand and fingers. It works by having the implant process the patient's thoughts and directly sending the required signals to the sleeve attached to his arm which results in movement, completely bypassing the patient's injured spinal cord.

The technology was developed through a partnership between the [Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center][1] and the Columbus-based [Battelle Memorial Institute][2].
