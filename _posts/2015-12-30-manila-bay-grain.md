<p class="lead">I'd have to admit that yes, I am a gear addict.</p>

I love using and pushing whatever it is that is latest and within my reach. I also love vintage mechanical stuff, old printing machines, old cameras and lenses, mechanical watches, etc... 

Mirrorless cameras allow me to marry these two passions of mine into a single hobby and my street photography is the product of that passion. I may suck at shooting street, but I love every single moment of it.

I've been using the Jupiter 37A a lot more these past few days on my [Sony A7SII][5] on my night street shooting here in [Manila][4]. It's fascinating how useful the images are even at an outrageously high ISO (up to 400k). The Jupiter 37A is a slow f/3.5 lens but works really well on this low light monster.

Taken using a [MC Jupiter-37A 135mm f/3.5 KMZ][6] lens at 1/20s f/4 ISO 12800. [See image on Flickr][1]{:target="_blank"} for EXIF. Posted originally on my [Instagram][2]{:target="_blank"}.
