<p class="lead">I was with a group of four on one of those roughly planned photo walks, in the rain, on our way to the port area when we ran into this man who just lit up a cigar.</p>

"_Sayang_", I said while motioning with my hand and camera if I could shoot so as not to lose the moment. It isn't an everyday thing here, seeing a man smoking a cigar in these parts. He answered by smiling and started laughing so I took that as a "yes" and started shooting as we started some light conversation.

I asked how he got hold of a cigar, he said, "a stranger came by and gave it to him, told him it's a cigarette".

"...like chocolate." That was how the cigar was like, according to the cigar man.

He lives in the streets which was pretty obvious, the foam mattress on his back, and him trying his best to keep dry says it all, so I didn't have to ask him about that. Trust me, they always get asked those same generic questions and sometimes they just want to have genuine conversations, some small talk with other regular people. I would try to seek him out to give him a small print of his picture the next time I am in the area.

### Street Photography POV Series.

As you can see from the video above, this is also the start of my own **Street Photography POV** (point-of-view) series, where I'd start taking video footage using a GoPro mounted on top of my camera. Other more notable street photographers have already started doing this and I thought it would be a great idea to produce content for my blog.

### My setup

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/articles/sony-a6000-leica-summicron35-gopro-session-setup-1260.jpg">

This is a Sony A6000 (ILCE-6000) mirrorless body with a Leica Summicron-M 1:2/35mm ASPH mounted using a Voigtlander VM-E Close Focus adapter. The strap is from Pacsafe, which I find to be a pretty secure camera strap that I can easily lug around my neck or wrap around my arm.

### Photos

<img class="extra-wide" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/articles/cigar-main-03761.jpg">

The images were taken using a Sony A6000 with a Leica Summicron-M 1:2/35 mm ASPH lens at 1/500s f/4 at ISO 1000 and processed in Lightroom. [See image on Flickr][1] for EXIF. Video was taken using a GoPro Hero 4 Session mounted on the camera via a cold shoe adapter and edited using iMovie.
