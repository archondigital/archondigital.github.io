Being upset for real on a Monday morning is something rare for me these days and since personal issues aren’t really the stuff I’d enjoy writing about, I could only go as far as to admit that I was in a situation where I was really upset to the point where I found out that I still had a lot of rage left in me. Yeah! if that ain’t a good thing then tell me I’m sick in the head or something.

There’s nothing like a good dose of Mastodon to keep me focused on my work. The music which most "normal" folks find as noisy, angry and offensive, and literally the sort of music blamed by conservatives to cause widespread rage, violence and suicide, has done exactly the opposite for me. Listening to Mastodon in the early hours of Monday morning gave me sort of a calm and soothing feeling and let much of the angst to subside.

The I hate Mondays series of posts that I just rhetoric and is nothing more. Don't take it literally, even if events these past few days have proven otherwise personally. For personal issues and all that crap, I put it all on my [Micro-blogging is Bittersweet Blog](http://pinapaitan.com), Pinapaitan which is filled with nothing but randomness, personal things and well um, micro blogging stuff from twitter, tumblr, youtube, last.fm and others.
