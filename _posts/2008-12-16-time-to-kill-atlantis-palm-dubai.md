Now I haven't really gone around much since arriving here in U.A.E. but was able to see a few sights in Dubai over the weekend. A friend took me to see the Atlantis, The Palm, Dubai which is 25 minutes away from my place without traffic.

> Atlantis, The Palm, Dubai is one outstanding landmark. A luxury hotel on the edge of one of Dubai's most famous mega project, The Palm.

I haven't gotten all my pictures uploaded but this one I took off the internet pretty much describes the place from outside.

They have an huge aquarium inside which is one of the hotel's featured attractions home to a number of species from whalesharks to tiny sharks, sting rays and schools of salt water fishes.

I will upload the photos of the aquarium when I get my card reader working again.

Until I get my internet connection working from home, I have all the time to kill after work.
