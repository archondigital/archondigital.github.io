Sometime middle of 2007, I found this [blank wordpress theme][1] and started using it as a base for theme designs I am working on. Tinkering with it helped me learn about creating a fully widgetized theme by editing and adding a few lines to the functions.php and sidebar.php files.<!--more-->

The CSS file has german comments which is just nice since now I know what &#8220;suche&#8221; is. All the templates&#8217; PHP files are commented in english which made things a whole lot easier for me in trying to take it apart.

What makes the theme perfect for me was it did not have any markup (no tags) of any kind and I was free to grab the PHP code and place it on my HTML. It made styling the theme a whole lot easier.
