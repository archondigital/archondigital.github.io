I have a friend that wanted their iPhone updated and I walked her through the installation remotely as she's in London and had to wait for the servers which I presume were all overloaded due to all the hype surrounding the release date of the 3.0 update. The logmein session I was running with her was going on for more than three hours and when I finally decided to call it quits, the update worked, phew…

It took us six tries before we successfully updated the iPhone but she was happy that everything was all working fine now. That was when we received reports from other people we know that the iPhone activation server was showing as temporarily unavailable or down due to the overload probably by having millions trying to download all at the same time.
