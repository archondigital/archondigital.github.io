<p class="lead">It appears Archon Digital has now been restored back to a PR2 site in this recent Google Pagerank update. Maybe all the effort Archon Digital has put into gaining back pagerank has been sort of working so far.</p>

For sometime now Archon Digitalâ€™s Google Pagerank has been dropped to zero after experimenting with two paid content articles last year. I have since gotten rid of the links and revised the articles to some extent as using Archon Digital for paid articles has never been part of the plan for this site. Maybe such paid postings can be implemented on other sites I intend to put up in the near future, but for now, all content on Archon Digital is will be written by me for my own pleasure.

On WordPress theme development, I am still looking at the schedule I put for myself as I really intend to release my own WordPress theme using the previous themes I put up for myself. All these will be ready within the 1st quarter of this new year.
