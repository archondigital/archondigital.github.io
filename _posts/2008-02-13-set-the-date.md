Here is an e-mail creative we came up with to help promote the hotel&#8217;s upcoming Valentine&#8217;s day promotions.

We were only given the name and copy for the campaign which was &#8220;Set the Date&#8221; and had to work around and come up with something to that effect. *Set the Date* was the third and last among our valentines campaign which had an overall theme of butterflies inside in a heart. The &#8220;butterflies in a heart&#8221; design came from <!--more-->one of my colleagues who created a vector artwork of some butterfly silhouettes inside a heart. His design can be seen in the background of the e-mail creative.

Since everything was being rushed, as is the case most of the time, we resorted to browsing for an image of some couple online and found the perfect match on <a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/file_closeup/people_specific_attributes/number_of_people/2_people/2034915_date.php?id=2034915" target="_blank">iStockphoto&#8217;s</a> website.

### The e-mail creative

<a title="Set the Date" rel="flickr-mgr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/22375586@N03/2259645259/"><img class="flickr-medium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2020/2259645259_74324f8b95_m.jpg" alt="Set the Date" /></a>

The e-mail campaign uses a set template, a corporate standard, from the hotel&#8217;s e-mail marketing platform. This template is limited and can only hold a picture and some footer copy so we designed the creative so users would get to click on the image for them to be sent to a landing page with all the details for the particular campaign.

### The Landing Page

As usual, since we were being rushed I merely provided the landing page design. No time for crafting a CSS/XHTML validating landing page as the present workflow is not optimized for that. Besides, I am not a coder by profession and would leave that to the real pros since my workload consists mostly of artwork for print and e-mail marketing campaigns. The landing page is online <a href="http://www.makatishangrila.com.ph/valentines/2008/set-the-date.html" target="_blank">here.</a>

Overall, we were happy the design was approved immediately and the campaign went smoothly with no problems.
