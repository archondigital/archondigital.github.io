<p class="lead">This was an accidental click.</p>

It was pitch black and I was just trying to measure the light when this figure literally popped into my frame as my eye was on the EFV, startling me. I almost jumped, but found myself clicking as I was catching my breath.

The old man was probably sitting behind the fence and must've heard me approaching. He probably got startled too.

I took this photo sometime in July while navigating a dark alley in Mandaluyong, Metro Manila.
