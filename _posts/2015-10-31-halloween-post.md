<p class="lead">This was an accidental click.</p>

It was pitch black and I was just trying to measure the light, then this figure literally popped into my frame as my eye was on the EFV startling me. And as if by reflex, I found myself clicking as I was catching my breath.

I took this photo sometime in July while navigating a dark alley in Mandaluyong, Metro Manila.
