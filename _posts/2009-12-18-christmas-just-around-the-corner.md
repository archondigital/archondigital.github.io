Yes, I hate shopping or strolling around pretending to shop. Don't get me wrong, I love Christmas and the true meaning of it and the whole package, but I definitely hate shopping. I'm more of a hit-and-run type of person and would come into the Mall to grab what I need and go. On some very rare occasions I'd scout only a few times and that is only if I really wanted what I was scouting for.

A few weeks ago I really wanted to buy myself a nice computer table but never really found what I wanted even after going through a dozen shops that sell them. I wanted a certain size and height and definitely wanted something more industrial rather than the flimsy Allen-Wrench-it-yourself computer table found on many stores out there. My schedule does not permit me yet to go to Gilmore Street in Quezon City or to HMR along Pioneer in Mandaluyong. Those places are where I'd most probably find the right type of table I'm looking for. Another option is S&R in the Fort and if I had the time like back in 2006, I'd rather make my own table from modal steel parts and some wood.

Going back to shopping, I'm still checking my list on what to shop for the people closest to me.
