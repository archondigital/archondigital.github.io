A kid refreshing himself from the urban heat with clean water. These are everyday scenes of people in this part of Manila where junkshops and homes exist right next to each other. In the background are the buildings of Makati's Central Business District.

Onyx St., San Andres Bukid, Manila.

This post is part of my [Humans of San Andres Bukid][3] series. I live nearby, I see this everyday. This is part of my neighborhood.

Taken with a Sony A6000 and a Nikon Nikkor 50mm f/1.2 AI-S lens at 1/320s f/8 ISO 100. [See image on Flickr][1]{:target="_blank"} for EXIF.
