Just migrated my site to the new .digital top level domain. The whole thing, including setting up 301 redirects in Apache, moving my old domain to an tiny PHP app on my Webfaction and making changes to Google Analytics, Webmaster tools and Disqus all took less than an hour. Though I hope I wasn't forgetting anything.

Migrating domains can be a tedious process but in this case it wasn't. This is my first time to perform a domain migration on a Jekyll site.

From the looks of it, everything seems to work fine. All my posts are now on the new archon.digital domain.
