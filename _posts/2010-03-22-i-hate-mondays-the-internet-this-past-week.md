Well I’ve long been off the 9 to 5 gig and is actually working more hours but on a flexible schedule so there’s no dreaded Mondays for me anymore. However, I still hate the idea for some reason.

It was actually the Monday morning commute which I loathed so much. You see, God loves Archon Digital so much that he has spared me from the grueling traffic and the giant billboards of heavily-photoshopped, underwear-clad models with the occasional stamped out navels that litter the stretch of EDSA.

Taking things you “hate” in a positive light can never be more hilarious, so here’s my take on the what I found interesting this past week on the Internet.

### On the Subject of Design by Jason Santa Maria

This post written last January 29 is an update of design books recommended by this amazing designer. Jason Santa Maria’s blog is one of the reasons I want to turn the Studio more into a blogazine than a portfolio. The blogazine concept never ceases to amaze me and is literally the direction I am taking now.

Getting hold of these book recommendations from top designers makes it easier for me to choose which books to invest in.

### Bloggista.com is for sale

Yes it is true, the owner of bloggista.com is selling his domain, as posted on his website, and I am determined to bid for it. I will double the existing bid and I’m willing to put my money on escrow for this one. He-he-he.

### Do Follow Blogs – Google Buzz Experiment by Pot Politics

John Sullivan has just launched what seems to me as a Google Buzz experiment for Do Follow bloggers. We will see how this turns out in the coming weeks.

Archon Digital <del>is a Do Follow blog</del>, though I seldom promote it as such as I prefer people to comment and later find out for themselves and comment just for the heck of it rather than for getting backlinks. But who am I kidding?, every blogger in his right mind would want to get do-follow backlinks.

### Dear Blog Engage Members, Can We Make History? by FMS SEO

Since launching the campaign to gain 100 votes on Blog Engage, FMS SEO’s author Karl Foxley has so far reached 62 votes. This is by far the most votes ever on a single post on Blog Engage. Compared to the big social bookmarking players out there 62 may seem like a small number, but for the thriving, dynamic community at Blog Engage this is history in the making. Blog Engage is a by invitation community of diverse bloggers, a cozy bunch.
