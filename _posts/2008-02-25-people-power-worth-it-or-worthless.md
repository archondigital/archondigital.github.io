It bothers me that to this day, no significant political change can cure the lingering cancer in our nation. That disease is corruption, a malignant and ruptured anomaly in our system, which inflicts our people&#8217;s way of life. This disease has ruptured and grown to the point where we all have to make a stand and face the problem head on.

I am writing this post in commemoration of what happened back in 1986. When Filipinos united as one and took a stand against a dictator and his generals. This was a time when us Pinoys were suddenly proud to be called Filipino.<!--more-->

Most of the younger generation have different ideas on what really happened on this historic day. This includes myself as I was only pre-school during the time but people in my family let us grow up learning the facts of life and the political chaos which surrounds us from early on. Here is my take on the following events.

## People Power I

In my opinion, the first of the two People Power revolutions proved itself to be a vital point in our history as it ushered a long overdue change from a corrupt dictatorship to a revolutionary government which transitioned later into a somewhat better democracy. President Aquino&#8217;s new democracy was full of promise, full of hope with an economy rising from the ashes of the previous crony-driven, corrupt economy. An economy which was forever damaged due to the multiple coup attempts and other events during that time. It is a shame that all the lives sacrificed prior to 1986 continue to seek justice to this day.

## People Power II

The second one was a failure altogether. It was a failure as the people were not able to select their chosen leader to replace former President Estrada as there was no immediate presidential election right after. Up to this day facts leading to the former President&#8217;s ouster and his imprisonment, the expected conviction and eventual pardon are still being mixed up with all the speculation surrounding it. Only when the dust of what is now our chaotic political landscape settles in can there be a true factual account of the things that really happened on People Power II.

## Now What?

Things are brewing up for another regime change. The present political structure with its pathetic multi-party system, the pork barrel, and the disease of corruption continues to eat up on our society&#8217;s very core.

Now I am already a head of family, a father of three and no longer that child who once witnessed a bloodless revolution. I fear for my family as this impending regime change might not be a bloodless one.

At present I don&#8217;t see no light at the end of the tunnel, at least not just yet. We are now in a very dark political episode in our history. It is a time for us to finally decide how to handle corruption not only from a political perspective but from a change in the basic way of life of every Filipino. This very basic way of life has been inflicted with corruption, hopelessness and delusions of poverty, as some are not really &#8220;poor&#8221; but merely &#8220;think poor&#8221;.

Unless we take a conscious effort to cure our mindset and our way of life, then our dark tunnel will see no end and the cancer that surrounds us would soon consume us all.
