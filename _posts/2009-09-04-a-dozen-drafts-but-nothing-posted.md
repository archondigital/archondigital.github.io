Nothing happening lately on this site. Too much activities on marketing some projects on social networks like twitter, facebook and the rest have kept Archon Digital from blogging. It seems writing content on this site has crept down to a halt.

Perhaps it is about myself spending too much time microblogging, playing games, working and just can't seem to find the time to finish articles stuck in the drafts section. Archon Digital needs to find the right direction as the site now lingers from one topic to another and ending up as losing it's focus.

The redesign has been completed on Photoshop but somehow coding will take some more time as I am thinking of using readily available platforms and adapt my design in order to take advantage of the built-in SEO and valid markup.

Updates will follow on a more regular basis from now on.
