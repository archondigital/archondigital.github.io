	<p class="lead">Art & Copy is a powerful documentary about advertising and inspiration.</p>

	<p class="lead">The film, directed by Doug Pray of (SURFWISE, SCRATCH, HYPE!), brings you a different perspective into the creative work and wisdom of the most influential advertising professionals.</p>

	<p>Though these people are well-known within the creative industry, they continue to live in the shadows, in the background, often misunderstood, with the general public knowing not that these creative people, has in fact, made a profound impact to our culture, our way of life and our thinking.</p>

	<p>I have always admired people with such brilliant minds that come up with ideas that explore the intricacies of human emotions, expose it and use that power to make a difference.</p>

	<blockquote>
		There are a lot of people in this business, but damn few really good ones
	</blockquote>

	<p>How these people come up with ideas that influence millions of people’s lives is no ordinary feat. Art & Copy takes to a journey into the minds of these brilliant people. What I like about the film is not how it tackles the “how” of making these great ads, but more into the philosophy that drives these genius minds to work, what they think about and how they make something out of anything they get their hands on.</p>

	<p>Welcome to the devil’s workshop – advertising is evil.  A lot of people would criticize the advertising industry, generalizing that advertising is evil, manipulative and misleading, and that the world would be better off without it. But I tell you this, you may have the best idea in the world, the best product, the best of the best of everything you can come up with, but without a good pitch and a some creativity in the mix, your reach would be very limited.</p>

	<p>Advertising is a powerful tool that can turn your voice, your idea or your product into one life-changing experience.</p>
