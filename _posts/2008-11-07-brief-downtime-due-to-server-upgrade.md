Archon Digital was down for less than 30 minutes this morning due to a system upgrade on the server.

The Ubuntu server hosting this site has upgraded from Gutsy 7.10.1 to 8.04.1 LTS Hardy Heron, a move which was long overdue but was put on hold for the longest time due to technical problems encountered during the first attempt and conflicting schedules on the sysadmin&#8217;s part.

Today&#8217;s upgrade went smoothly and soon we will evaluate the possibility of migrating all of the sites to a new server running a clean install of Ubuntu Intrepid 8.10.
