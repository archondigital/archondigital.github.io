<blockquote><p>How beautiful life is, and how sad. There is no past and no future, only a limitless now</p><cite>James Clavel, Shogun</cite></blockquote>

<p class="lead">The rich Japanese culture has always fascinated me. The Samurai, shogun, Forty-Seven Ronin (元禄赤穂事件) are among those that captured my interest which all started after I read this book when I was a kid.</p>

This Monday, I started E-mail Marketing training for our counterparts over in Tokyo.

The course involves a primer on the basics of E-mail Marketing, its importance and step-by-step instructions using our company software designed for e-mail campaigns.<!--more-->

Majority of the training will involve Photoshop lessons as well since most of the e-mail templates involve designing, grouping and nesting layers and slicing in Photoshop. It is good that the person I am training has a bit of experience in Photoshop as it will save us enough time for me to put more emphasis on the other important parts of the course.

Today we are on the third day of training and so far we have been able to cover most of the basics and is running through to the part where Photoshop comes in.

I was excited at the possibility of traveling, but due to cost cutting, plus the uncertainty of the global economy, I will have to settle for remote training sessions using one of my newest best friend, LogMeIn.

<a href="http://www.logmein.com" target="_blank">Logmein</a> is a very useful service which deserves it's very own review. But that review will be for after I conduct this training.

So far, the training has went well, with the exception of some secondary software lacking on the trainee's workstation, everything else seems to fall into place.

Maybe I can visit there when I am on vacation some time in the near future.
