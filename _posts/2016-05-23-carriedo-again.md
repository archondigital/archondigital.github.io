Took a little walk down Quiapo and Sta. Cruz again. I managed to take this photo before the security guard at the LRT station could stop me.

Taken using a [Leica Summicron-M 1:2/35mm ASPH][6] lens at 1/500s f/8 ISO 500. [See image on Flickr][1]{:target="_blank"} for EXIF. Posted originally on my [Instagram][2]{:target="_blank"}.
