Archon Digital has upgraded itself to a more community-friendly environment with the addition of dofollow commentluv links for the people who provide regular their insight and opinion on things posted on Archon Digital.<!--more-->

The removal of the Nofollow tag on commentluv links will work for commentators with 5 comments and above while comment authors are posted on a &#8220;Conspirators&#8221; list, a variation of the Top Commentators&#8217; List.

The widget &#8220;Our Community&#8221; can be seen on the [Mind Feed][1] since the other day where I placed Recent comments and a list of my top commenters.

Also the &#8220;[Network][2]&#8221; page has been re-designed where Archon Digital added this content as well as links to interesting blogs and communities where this website has been a part of. The page is now available on the main navigation bar.
