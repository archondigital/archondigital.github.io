So far I&#8217;m happy with what I came up with and I&#8217;ll be sticking and improving this design for some time.<!--more-->

## It has been a while since I&#8217;ve had this much fun

Migrating all my posts to a new permalink structure and redirecting each of my older posts took me a lot of time. Figuring it out took a few weeks of looking for solutions and almost decided to pay someone for the job. Eventually, I found a very simple plugin called [Permanent Redirector WordPress Plugin][1] for wordpress redirecting each post by creating a custom field containing the URL which you want to use for the 301 redirects.

## I can&#8217;t express myself well

At first I was actually trying to redirect manually using regular expressions directly on the server block on my vhost file in nginx. That would&#8217;ve been the most practical way but sadly I suck at it.

## Tidying Up

In the next few days I&#8217;d be finishing and polishing everything I need for the site. The other sections are still being worked on and being tested on a local Ubuntu box before I upload.
