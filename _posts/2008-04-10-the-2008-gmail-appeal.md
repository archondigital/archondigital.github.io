The dedicated folks at E-mail Standards Project has just launched their 2008 Gmail Appeal campaign which aims to make enough noise within the internet and hopefully convince Google to make their e-mail client more XHTML/CSS friendly.

[Email Standards Project &#8211; Gmail Grimaces][2] from [Mathew Patterson][3] on [Vimeo][4].

One of the things I encounter on a daily basis are HTML e-mail creatives not playing well with Gmail. A lot of times I am put in a situation where I am forced to use `<font>` tags, tables and other deprecated HTML code for my e-mail creative to &#8220;work&#8221;.

If the web design people have already adjusted well into the world of XHTML and CSS 2.0, then why are e-mail clients still rendering e-mail as if it was still 1998? The possible benefits of having a universal standard in place are numerous but most the important of these are lower bandwidth costs, improved client performance and enhanced presentation for mobile users and text-only email clients.

There are already a lot of e-mail clients with strong support for rendering XHTML/CSS e-mail creatives. These clients are AOL Webmail, Apple Mail, Eudora (Penelope), Microsoft Entourage, Mozilla Thunderbird, Windows Live Mail, Windows Mail, Yahoo! Mail and Yahoo! Mail (Classic).

Other e-mail clients which badly need to improve support for web standards are Apple .Mac, Lotus Notes 8, Microsoft Outlook 2007 and Windows Live Hotmail.

The <a href="http://www.email-standards.org" target="_blank">E-mail Standards Project</a> aims for designers to be able to rely on a solid, consistent level of web standards support in designing and building HTML emails. This will make our lives easier so we don&#8217;t have to grimace or make ugly faces whenever e-mail clients don&#8217;t render well. <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/v5/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
