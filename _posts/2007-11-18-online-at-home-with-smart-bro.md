Just had wireless internet installed at home. This means we'd be able to log on a lot more often and update the site. I am also about to re-design this site and you'll see more of that in the next few weeks as I now have more time to be online.<!--more-->

This is just my first day with Smart Bro as my wireless broadband provider and their connection speed seems to be okay though I've had a lot of negative feedback from a lot of disgruntled users. But they're still the fastest when it comes to installation as compared to other providers. We encountered some difficulty, but mostly problems on my PC, which caused a very frustrating delay yesterday afternoon. The morning after, the entire installation process went smoothly and I'm posting now to test the connection speed so let's see what happens.
