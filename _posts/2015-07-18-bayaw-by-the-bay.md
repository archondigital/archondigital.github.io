It was raining, we were stuck in traffic and passed under a bridge and this is where I found this man taking a nap on the levee by the river.

Taken with a Sony A6000 using a Nikkor 50mm f/1.2 AI-S lens at 1/60s f/1.2 ISO 1600. [See image on Flickr][1] for EXIF. Posted originally on my [Instagram][2].
