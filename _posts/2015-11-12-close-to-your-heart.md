<p class="lead">Hold close to your heart those that are dearest to you. And yes, I'm talking about your iPhone.</p>

The guy in the background didn't take the man's phone but just minutes later offered me a watch and an iPhone 6. He must be a good salesman, selling wares in the streets at night at such a bargain.

I didn't plan or frame the shot properly it just happened in a split-second. Photographed along Pedro Gil St., Ermita, [Manila][4] in one of my walks at night.

Taken with a Sony A6000 with a Leica Summicron-M 1:2/35mm ASPH at 1/100s f/2 ISO 6400. [See image on Flickr][1]{:target="_blank"} for EXIF.
