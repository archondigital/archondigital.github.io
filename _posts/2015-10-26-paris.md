A man and his tiny dog, walking the streets of Paris.

The last time I was here in [Paris][2]{:target="_blank"}, I only had an iPhone 5s with me and used that to [shoot around][3]{:target="_blank"}.

Taken with a [Sony A6000][4] and a Leica Summicron-M 1/2:35mm ASPH 35mm lens at 1/400s f/2.8 ISO 320. [See image on Flickr][1]{:target="_blank"} for EXIF.
