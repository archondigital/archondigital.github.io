My current Internet provider is Smart Broadband Inc. and I’m on the Share-IT plan 999. I’m literally stuck with this for the remaining 19 months of the lock-in period. This lock-in period is just too long for someone like me to get tied to as I would gladly move to another network should something better come out. Truth is, I’ve been negotiating with someone, a normal user, to continue to use and keep my subscription as it does the job for normal uses anyway. If this pushes through I’d get myself a hard line either from PLDT or Sky Broadband whichever ISP can install first. I need a higher bandwidth plan from what most ISPs can offer and is even considering a business account. But if Sky Broadband’s 3 Mbps or 6 Mbps plan would work out fine, then I’d go for that.

Yesterday morning I checked speedtest.net to see if there was an improvement to my internet speed.

The reason I got the SmartBro Share-IT was for me to be able to roam around the city, either on an inverter while inside a moving vehicle or on a mobile battery pack while I am outdoors. This idea has not been fully realized just yet.

The internet speed has been erratic at most times and you’d have more bad days than good ones. Since [Smart Broadband’s recent press release](http://technology.inquirer.net/infotech/infotech/view/20100404-262374/Smart-bumps-up-broadband-Internet-speed-for-households) on having an average of 2.0 Mbps, I opted to run an experiment to see if internet speeds have indeed improved.

Another test an hour later revealed a slower result. And then when I had to upload a few files via SFTP it just failed. Connecting via VPN for something work related proved unsuccessful.

You cannot always blame your ISP but the hard truth is Smart Broadband and most ISPs in this country are lagging behind their counterparts elsewhere around the globe. If you want more people to become internet entrepreneurs and have this country become as globally competitive as possible, then these telecoms / ISP companies would have to do more to improve their infrastructure.

At present, the only way to tweak my internet speed is by choosing a public DNS as Smart Bro’s DNS is so slow and doesn’t resolve well on other websites. There is a lot more to tackle with Smart Bro’s DNS but the issue is best reserved for another article. Latency is another issue that needs to be addressed as that too would be best discussed on another post.

Nothing personal Smart Bro, I do the same thing with Etisalat and bash them when I was in Dubai. You can make all the speed and coverage claims as said on your ads, but really your service is still not at par with the rest of the world for your users to become globally competitive.
