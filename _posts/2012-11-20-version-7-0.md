		<p class="lead">Last week, I took down <a href="http://archondigital.com">archondigital.com</a> and worked on a re-design after almost a year of neglecting the template I used on version 6.0 of this website. After almost a week of working on the new design, I made the site available again this Sunday and started working on new content.</p>

		<p>The new version improves upon the features I put on the last one and takes advantage of upcoming WordPress features. I'm now testing it on a local installation of WordPress 3.5 beta on my laptop. I built this theme using <a href="http://themefortress.com/reverie/">Reverie</a> and <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com">Zurb Foundation</a> as base.</p>
