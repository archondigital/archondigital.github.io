Last week, I took down [archondigital.com][1] and worked on a re-design after almost a year of neglecting the template I used on version 6.0 of this website. After almost a week of working on the new design, I made the site available again this Sunday and started working on new content.

The new version improves upon the features I put on the last one and takes advantage of upcoming WordPress features. I&#8217;m now testing it on a local installation of WordPress 3.5 beta on my laptop. I built this theme using [Reverie][2] and [Zurb Foundation][3] as base.
