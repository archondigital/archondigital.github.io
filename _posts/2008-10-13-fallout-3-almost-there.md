<p class="lead">The best non-linear, role playing game I have ever played are games Fallout and Fallout 2. Since then, I have always been waiting for the third release (Fallout 3).</p>

I have followed news about the game's development progress privately, but am now excited this whole thing is pushing through and is to be released in two weeks from now.<!--more-->

## Fallout 3, The Game

In the game, *Fallout 3* takes place in the year 2277, 36 years after the what took place in *Fallout 2* which is roughly 200 years after the great nuclear war that devastated the world. The player character hails from *Vault 101*, a fallout shelter serving the Washington, D.C. area. The player character one day wakes up finding that his/her father has left the vault and gone off into the wasteland for reasons unknown. He/She then decides to go out into the Capital Wasteland in search of him after the vault *overseer* becomes suspicious that the player had something to do with the father's disappearance. And so the story begins for our character as the player encounters organizations seen in the previous games, including the Brotherhood of Steel and the Enclave.

## Prepare for the Future

A <a href="http://prepareforthefuture.com/" target="_blank">flash teaser site</a>** **was launched featuring clips of what to expect from the game such as the The Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System, or VATS and the Metro *Protector**<span style="font-style: normal;"> (&#8220;Tickets Please&#8221;) </span><span style="font-style: normal;">destorying two Supermutants who wandered off into his Metro station</span><span style="font-style: normal;">.</span>*

I really like the idea of being able to combine different weapons and weapons that deteriorate / degenerates through time. And also *Dogmeat*, which will be able to fetch suplies and ammunition for you during gameplay.

Some specualtion on a leaked review version for the Xbox 360 has been floating around on various P2P sites but Bethesda Softworks has not made any public announcements on this subject.

This could also be the only available copy of this game which has references to morphine or other real world drugs which has been removed from the game to allow for it to be sold legally in all countries that are strict with game classification.

## <span style="font-weight: normal;">So When Is Fallout 3 Coming out?</span>

As taken from their site:

> *The game will be released in North America on October 28, 2008, in Europe and Australia on October 30, 2008, in the United Kingdom on October 31, 2008, and in Japan on December 4, 2008.*

Soon enough I will buy this game either through friends in the States or through Australia. I prefer the The Survival Edition which will be available for purchase through Amazon for U.S. customers only.
