excerpt: "Spending Christmas eve with the family via webcam. Can't figure out why the webcam at home seems too grainy but it's better than not being able to see them at all. I sure wish Skype worked in U.A.E. but had to settle for Yahoo Messenger for now."

After the webcam session with the people at home in my folks place, where I got to have some time to see the kids and check how everything is going, I took a cab to Corniche St. and went to Hardee's and grabbed myself a decent sandwich. It was my only really decent meal of the day and I figured spending Christmas alone wouldn't be so sad if I didn't actually think about it too much. Eating can be as disastrous and tragic as contemplating on suicide by cops.

Being away for a while gets to you in a certain way that you have only yourself to keep you company, to keep you sane. I've only been away for three weeks but it almost feels like an eternity to me. Not being able to see my wife and kids on a daily basis is the hardest part. Waking up alone every day, skipping breakfast, grabbing coffee outside and trying hard to hail and actually get into a taxi cab to get myself to work seems to be my routine now.

But all of this is for a reason, everything for a cause more valuable than an individual's emotions. My emotions are of no value compared to the goals I have right now. A lot more was at stake, something so important that I would have to let go of these human emotions and follow through with my strategic goals. This is all for my family's future as well as for my own career advancement.

## Happy Holidays!
