Nocturnal people like Archon have lived 80% of their lives in the secluded confines of the cold night where their minds are more active, creative and responsive. Every single artwork, process, device and innovation were somehow all forged during these dark wee hours of the night up to early morning.

## the catalyst

قهوة‎ or _qahweh_ was one of the catalysts for most of these like-minded nocturnals. The night belonged to Archon Digital and this serum known more to mortal man as coffee was an essential part of it.

(Ol’ Blue Eyes once said, “they put coffee in the coffee in… ______” can someone remind the author where exactly through the comments section at the end of this senseless posting)

## now, the Daywalker

What was once considered an abomination, an impossibility is now a reality.

Since the exodus, Archon wakes up and comes to work at 8:00 am on the dot, sometimes much earlier. He does so even while his time is under his own control without anyone running after his neck for being late. No morning meetings, no time card or biometric scanners just plain coming to work on time.

## old habits die hard…

The only thing that hasn’t changed is the time Archon leaves the workplace or stops working in general. He still goes home late and mostly stays late up at night trying to get that creative juice running again.

Perhaps everything around Archon is just a simulation or an artificial reality implanted on his mind about the world around him. This could be the work of some higher beings who might have snatched him in the middle of his sleep and messed up with his neural frequencies.

a refusal to conform… reality bites in…
Archon refuses to be a part of the herd but this new reality surrounding him seems to stick in and will be part of his mortal side for some time.

He now really thinks that it feels good to be able to start early in the day. This hopefully will have more time for Archon Digital to execute other more sinister plans for his ultimate goal of world domination. The overlord is merely waiting for a new server to be available to run the second phase of Archon Digital’s the pillage of the internet.
