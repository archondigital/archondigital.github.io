<p class="lead">A lot of things going on in my life offline and these past few months I made a decision not to blog at all.</p>

There’s the new gig, a lot of interesting experiences, new people and some personal matters going on and I’m not really sure how I would communicate it all through Archon Digital. I always felt I needed to write down the things on my mind whether to blog it or just write down or doodle my thoughts and stash it somewhere.

A few months ago I turned off my social media lifestream, [Pinapaitan](http://pinapaitan.com) and is thinking about re-launching it at a later date (some new ideas started pouring in). I turned it off because it was just publishing junk I was posting on twitter, youtube and facebook and stuff in between, cross-posting with each other and causing so much digital feedback mixed up with my personal posts.

> I miss blogging.
