This man caught my attention one late afternoon while I was having coffee near the Manila Yacht Club. He was attempting to catch some fish in the murky waters of Manila bay. His semi-pro fishing rod suggests he may not be doing this out of desperation, but the pollution in this part of the bay is just so terrible that it would be impossible to find something that&#8217;s still safe to eat.

It bothers me that Manila bay is not clean enough for people to bathe in or to fish on, and that at present, there are other more desperate people who would not think twice about eating whatever they catch in these waters if only to satisfy their hunger.
