Sitting in a coffee shop thinking of my plans for the coming year while thinking things like this are better thought about over a bottle or two of nice cold beer&#8230;<!--more-->

Twenty thirteen is going to be a very, very busy one and I can&#8217;t wait for it to start. This year, I plan to get [Archon Digital][1] registered locally and will start marketing both online and offline. I&#8217;m also looking at hiring an assistant and one or two developers to keep up with the load of work as they come in.

I promised myself a few months ago that I wouldn&#8217;t drink as much as I did in last year&#8217;s holiday season. Just to make things clear, I&#8217;m no alcoholic. I only drink occasionally, but I&#8217;m also no triathlete or health buff. That brings me to the idea of further cutting down on what little amount that I do drink and start to get more exercise, and diet, lose weight, and all that eat-only-organic-stuff-healthy-living,Â thingamajig. This 2012, my actual fitness plan was to get grandma&#8217;s exercise machine from her place to my house. That was it, that was the plan. This 2013 though, I better start using the thing.

Seems everything is going as planned, though I&#8217;d still look forward to enjoying a glass of scotch or maybe some cold beer while I look back at 2012 and plan for what&#8217;s coming ahead.
