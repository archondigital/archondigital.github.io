Small Potato has <a href="http://www.wpdesigner.com/2008/03/21/wpdesigner-change-of-ownership/" target="_blank">sold WPDesigner</a> for the huge sum of $66,000 dollars. This is a really good deal for a 21-month old, PR7 site. WPDesigner has been a great online resource with really useful wordpress themes and tutorials.

I&#8217;ve been following this since last week when Small Potato announced that <a href="http://www.wpdesigner.com/2008/03/11/wpdesignercom-is-for-sale/" target="_blank">WPDesigner is for sale</a> to the highest bidder. It had me think about what would happen to the site after it gets sold.<!--more-->

According to Small Potato, the new owner, Pawel Ciszewski, will still continue with the recently launched Themes Club where I was able to join for free thanks to <a href="http://www.themelab.com/2008/03/04/wpdesigner-5-themes-club-free/" target="_blank">Themelab</a>. Small Potato will also continue to guest post on WPDesigner as he goes on with his traveling.

We are all happy for Small Potato, I sure hope we&#8217;d get somewhere near the success of his work. At 21 with his entire life still ahead of him, he&#8217;s the real deal wordpress rockstar.

Which makes me think, what would a guy in Thailand at 21 years old do if he had $66,000 on your hand?
