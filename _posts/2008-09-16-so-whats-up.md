What&#8217;s been keeping me busy lately is work and a ton of other stuff like the upcoming migration (from [archon-digital.com][1]) to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">archondigital.com</a> where I&#8217;m still having problems as I made some very drastic changes to my permalink structure.

The way my site handles the content that my new site would be very different as well as how I will implement some stuff I picked up along the way thas supposed to help me make my site rank better and validate better.

Right now this site is a mess and I can&#8217;t wait to flip the switch.
