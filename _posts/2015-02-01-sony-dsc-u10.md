<p class="lead">I just realized that my I first digital camera was actually a Sony. A blue Cybershot DSC-U10 like that on the picture.</p>

It was back in 2003 when I got this tiny Cybershot so I could get photos of my son who was then just a little over a year old. During that time, these tiny Cybershots were all the rage. They we're pocketable and digital and had a whopping 1.3 megapixels of imaging power, fixed 5.0mm 1:2.8, auto focus, "auto marco" and rechargable AAA nickel metal hydride batteries ([See DP review article from 2002][3] for more accurate specs).

I accidentally found this [Japanese][1] blog post while working early Sunday morning and couldn't help but recall all the nice memories I've captured with it. You can still find the manual for this on the [Sony support website][2].

Unfortunately, this camera was stolen from me back in the same year by a white guy who conned me and my friends, but that's a different story altogether.
