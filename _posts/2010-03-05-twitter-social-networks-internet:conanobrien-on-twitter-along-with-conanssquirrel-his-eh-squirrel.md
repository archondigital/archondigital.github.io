Out of curiosity after checking out [Mashable’s post on @ConanOBrien](http://mashable.com/2010/03/03/conans-tweet-team/) as being the verified Twitter account of the former host of the Tonight Show, I just had to log in and see for myself. I found it amusing to see Conan O’Brien tweet usual funny quips and even if borrowing one from George Carlin‘s “Jumbo Shrimp” line, still it was very funny.

[@ConanOBrien](http://twitter.com/ConanOBrien) not only has a huge and almost immediate following in the hundreds of thousands but it is also worth noting that there is a funny side story to this Twitter account with [Conan’s local squirel, @ConansSquirrel](http://twitter.com/ConansSquirrel), as a follower and tweeting in tandem with Conan’s tweets. I find these squirrel point-of-view tweets to be the most funny part of it and can’t help not to laugh at every tweet coming from both accounts. At one point the squirrel was tweeting about Conan leaving the house, wearing his “big boy clothes” and all this while Conan tweets about going for a job interview at Home Depot.

Here’s one of Conan’s tweets…

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Today I connected all the freckles on my arm with a Sharpie. It spells out RIKSHAZ9LIRK. Clearly I am The Chosen One.</p>&mdash; Conan O&#39;Brien (@ConanOBrien) <a href="https://twitter.com/ConanOBrien/statuses/9693694076">February 26, 2010</a></blockquote>

And here is one from his squirrel…

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Hey, where&#39;s my sharpie?</p>&mdash; Conan&#39;s Squirrel (@ConansSquirrel) <a href="https://twitter.com/ConansSquirrel/statuses/9693952562">February 26, 2010</a></blockquote>

He is doing a good job at keeping his supporters and the rest of the world in the loop while waiting for the time he can legally appear elsewhere. Conan is bound by contract to not appear on any other network until September 2010 as part of the end-of-contract conditions agreed upon with NBC.

Conan O’Brien definitely is bumming out until that time but one thing is clear, he has cornered for himself a crowd that would follow him wherever network he goes. And to think this article is written by a loyal David Letterman viewer.
