Today is D-Day. I got a friendly e-mail reminder from spreadfirefox.com on Download Day (17:00 UTC on June 18, 2008) for the official release of Firefox 3. The guys from Mozilla Foundation are on a mission to set a Guinness World Record for the most software downloaded in 24 hours. <!--more-->Firefox 3 is Mozilla&#8217;s latest stable release of the browser which boasts of a ton of new features and significant performance improvements over the previous version which I discussed in an 

<a href="http://archon-digital.com/studio/software/firefox-3-beta-4/" target="_self">article</a> I wrote a few months back.

After successfully downloading and installing the browser on my home computer, I went to the office and began my Firefox 3 Download Day session as well. So far, download speeds have started to slow down, almost to a halt, from where I&#8217;m at. One can only imagine the load on their servers as the millions who pledged started downloading almost simultaneously. <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2008/06/17/kicking-off-firefox-3-download-day-with-a-boom/" target="_blank">The Mozilla Blog</a> is reporting that they were able to exceed the 1.6 million first day download record of Firefox 2 within only the first five hours of releasing Firefox 3.

On my previous article on <a href="http://archon-digital.com/studio/software/firefox-3-beta-4/" target="_blank">Firefox Beta 4</a>, one of the issues raised by my readers and myself was the lack of compatibility with Linky, which seems to be a favorite tool by people on Entrecard. I personally like using Linky for Entrecard dropping as it has its advantages, but lately I have not been able to use the add-on.

Another weird issue I encountered was that I was able to use Linky and on both firefox 2 and Firefox 3 at the same time on my PC though I was not able to duplicate the same feat on my other computers.

Let&#8217;s help get the word out and start switching over to Firefox 3.
