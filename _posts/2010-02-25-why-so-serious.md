<p class="lead">That's my little guy, Steven after finishing his grape juice.</p>

So what has been keeping Archon Digital from getting some serious attention? I have a post soon to publish on my findings and what I am going to do about my [Facebook Fan Box][2] since obrserving it for about a month where I have come up with a few more ideas on that subject. A few SEO efforts, dabbling into link wheeling and link building, elsewhere not here, has given me more drive to figure out the search engine trade.

Major changes are coming to websites I manage in my work and I promised myself to finish them all before updating or making any changes to Archon Digital. I’m currently building a portfolio section over there at work and is excited that I will be able to finish real soon. [WordPress][1] is simply a fantastic tool to work with and I couldn’t think of [anything else][1] better to say about it.

Earlier this year I’ve made this silent goal of how much money I should be making passively within the year and have taken steps to getting closer to that goal. I have shared my ideas, albeit roughly with a friend and he seems interested in my proposal. We'll see how this goes, as I am confident of the success of this upcoming venture.
