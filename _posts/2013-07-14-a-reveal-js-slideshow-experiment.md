# A Slideshow

## What is Reveal.js?

Reveal.js is a framework for developing presentations using HTML and was created by <a href="http://hakim.se" target="_blank">Hakim El Hattab</a>.

<small>Swipe downward or press the down arrow key.</small>  
</section> <section> I started playing around with reveal.js a few months ago while I was looking for ways to display a slide presentation inline on a post without having to embed PDFs or slideshows from an external source.

## A WordPress Post Template

For this experiment, I implemented the slideshow as a post template on WordPress on my blog. Each slide is generated from *section* elements that you hardcode on the HTML editor.

<small>Swipe or press the right arrow key.</small>

## Responsive and Plays fairly well  
with Foundation Framework

I&#8217;ve been testing this on my iPhone and on an Android device and it works almost perfectly. In fact, I&#8217;m writing this post from an iPad Mini.

## Where do I intend to use it?

The idea is to use this framework to create interactive infographics and slide presentations for [briefers][1] and [Institutional Memory][2].

## Want to see more features?

I won&#8217;t be showing any further features here as I plan to showcase the rest of Reveal&#8217;s capabilities on actual infographics. 

You can view a fully-functional <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/" target="_blank">demo</a> showcasing all its features on the author&#8217;s website.

## Not into coding? No problem!

Not everyone wants to get their hands dirty with code but that doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t use this to wow your boss or something. 

<a href="http://slid.es/" target="_blank">Slid.es</a> is a free visual online editor for creating mind-blowing Reveal.js slideshows.
