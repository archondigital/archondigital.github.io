# Archon Digital

Hi, I'm Jon, a.k.a [@archondigital][1], and this is my personal website. Here I publish blog entries on my interests and on the things that keep my busy, from web design, frontend development, street photography, tech gear, gaming and music. This site runs on Jekyll, Foundation 5 and Liquid templating. Powered by Github Pages.


I'm a graphic designer who started in print before shifting to design and development on the web.

Since 2005, I've been doing frontend development and some work on servers both during work and in my free time. When I am not at work, I take photographs of the street life around me either in film or on digital.

This Jekyll site is an exercise on developing my own flat file CMS running on Jekyll, Foundation 5 and Liquid templating. I hope to be able to publish more information on this soon on [my blog][1].

I currently work in the Presidential Communications Development and Strategic Planning Office as technical lead in the development of the [Official Gazette PH][3], [Open Data PH][4] and its other online initiatives.

This is my personal website. What I post here, my views, rants, etc... does not in any way represent that of the office that I currently work for.
